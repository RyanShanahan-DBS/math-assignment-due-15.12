Problem 2,  math assignment 

Design an algorithm that will read a series of integers at the terminal. The first integer is special, as it indicates how many more integers will follow. 
The first integer must be between 3 and 10. Your algorithm is to calculate the sum and average of the integers, excluding the first integer, and display these values to the screen.
The program must also display the minimum and the maximum number entered excluding the first integer.
Write an algorithm in the form of Pseudocode and flowchart. Perform desk checking (include desk check table). Implement it in Python or C#.
